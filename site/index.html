            <p><h3 id='why_shoes'>Why Shoes?</h3>

<p>The first RailsBridge teaching project is a short series introducing a 4th/5th grade class to programming. We decided to use <a href='http://shoooes.net/'>Shoes</a> and the Ruby programming language.</p>

<p>To quote one <a href='http://groups.google.com/group/railsbridge/msg/2c41610f8cc570b4?hl=en'>Railsbrige comment</a> Kids want to learn something that is:</p>

<p>A. Fun</p>

<p>B. Easy</p>

<p>Ok, maybe Ruby isn&#8217;t so easy, but relative to a lot of modern programming languages it is pretty good. There is very little &#8220;boilerplate.&#8221; Programs are fairly concise and to the point. I wouldn&#8217;t touch Javascript for kids since the implementations are so inconsistent. Kids can deal with rules as long as they are clearly explained and consistent.</p>

<p>Also, Ruby is a &#8220;real&#8221; programming language that real-world programmers use for practical purposes. It is effective to teach kids skills that adults use. When I did research for establishing the curriculum goals for our elementary school, I read a lot about &#8220;21st century learning skills&#8221; where kids learn to use computers and other tech as tools, in the similar manner to how adults use those tools (beyond using &#8220;educational software&#8221; for teaching specific subjects). I find from personal experience that kids are very motivated when they are learning something that could have application outside of the classroom.</p></p>
          
            <h3><a href="/2009/05/19/what-is-this-about.html">What's this about?</a></h3>
            <p><h3 id='whats_this_about'>What&#8217;s this about?</h3>

<p>There are a few reasons why it is important to teach kids how to develop computer applications:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>A Different Way to Think</strong> kids should learn computer programming for the same reasons they should learn a foreign language or the scientific process. Programming requires a different sort of thinking and problem solving than other disciplines. It is good brain exercise.</li>

<li><strong>Understanding Our World</strong> Just as kids who learn to write fiction gain a greater understand of reading a novel, so do kids who learn to program gain a greater understanding of the software tool they will use in their lives. We teach kids to have a basic understanding of the world around them, from electricity to physics to the periodic table. This knowledge helps them understand the world they live in, regardless of whether it is directly applicable in their careers.</li>

<li><strong>Inspire (some of) Them to Become Software Engineers</strong> Internationally there is a gender imbalance amongst software engineers. In the US, that imbalance extends to race and class. it is critical that the people who create the tools that humans use for problem solving are representative of the diverse people on the planet. Besides it is no fun working in a homogeneous crowd or, even worse, feeling like a token &#8220;other.&#8221; For those kids that have a hankering to do this kind of work, they need to know that it is an option for them.</li>
